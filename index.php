        <!-- <p>
          I have experience in helping people express their business message through my work. Through my interest in culture and history, I draw my inspiration from many different places and periods. I believe that my knowledge of both historical and contemporary design allows me to select from the best of both. For me, great design is a balance between the idea, creativity and technical execution.
        </p> -->
        <p>My name is Maciek Doczyk. Iâ€™m a graphic designer working for a biotechnological company in Galway, Ireland. I provide a high standard graphic design service, including scientific illustrations, logos, infographics and much more.
