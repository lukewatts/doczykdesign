            My name is Maciek, and I am a Graphic Designer, a native of Poland but based in Galway, Ireland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just some of the services I offer are scientific illustrations, presentations, logos, brand identity, and website graphics in addition to publishing. 
            In my work I ensure quality and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied Interior Design at Griffith College in Dublin, and am presently working as Graphic Designer in NFB, a Biotechnological Company based in Galway. 
            I have designed a number of high-quality scientific images, and a layout for newsletters and flyers. 
            As part of a team of professionals in a very busy and exacting environment, I am expected to meet deadlines and produce work of a high standard.
          </p>

            I have experience in helping people express their business message through my work. 
            Through my interest in culture and history, I draw my inspiration from many different places and periods. 
            I believe that my knowledge of both historical and contemporary design allows me to select from the best of both. 
            For me, great design is a balance between the idea, creativity and technical execution.
